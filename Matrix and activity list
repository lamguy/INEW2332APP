So just run though, what are we doing about the group project?
For the Requ Matrix, I think some things we will need are just our notepad++ or develpers pad, 
apache and DB, the OS, log in page, etc. Is that going in the right direction of a matrix, lol.
So for the activities, we can make a login page, the DB to login to, an acct page, log out page, 
registration page, and user and admin accts. Anything else? I also posted Github btw too.
Im not sure really what type or look or format she wants in the matrix or activities list... Anyone know?
